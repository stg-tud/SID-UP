++   3   implement more funny event things (snapshot, merge etc)
++   3   implement folding signal
        -> cannot fold over continuous things
        -> only event.fold
        -> need events first
0   4   restrict event processing ordering only to where needed (folding signal and outside observers)
-   2   implement exception propagation
0   3   allow partial GC of dependency graphs
0   2   allow remote var inclusion in transactions
+   10  communication failure tolerance?
