+   2   proper solution for source dependencies / late reactive creation
        -> Map[UUID, UUID] to Map[UUID, (UUID, Set[UUID])] of lastEvent and set of early-propagated events per source? 
+   ??  implement more funny event things
+   10  implement proper demo application (CRUD??)
-   2   implement exception propagation
0   3   allow partial GC of dependency graphs bottom up (discard var's and dependants that aren't referenced anymore and thus won't produce further updates)
0   3   allow partial GC of dependency graphs top down (hold unobserved dependants with weak references so they can be discarded if no outside holds on to them) 
0   2   allow remote var inclusion in transactions
+   10  communication failure tolerance?
+   15  dependency set changes
+   10  bidirectional signals/reactives
